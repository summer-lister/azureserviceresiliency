### Key Points:
1. **Resiliency Methods**: These Azure resources have built-in resiliency features like Availability Zones, Availability Sets, and auto-scaling to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
2. **Multiregion Disaster Recovery Strategy**: Most of the resources, like **Azure Site Recovery (ASR)**, **Traffic Manager**, and **Front Door**, are used to manage disaster recovery and high availability across multiple regions.
3. **Pricing**: Prices for resiliency and multiregion support depend on the specific services, like traffic routing, VM sizes, storage, and geo-replication. Each service has a **pay-as-you-go** pricing model.
4. **Documentation**: Links provided lead to official Azure documentation for more detailed setup and configuration of resiliency and disaster recovery features.
